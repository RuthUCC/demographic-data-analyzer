Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This project implements a Python function `calculate()` that computes statistical measures on a 3x3 matrix derived from a list of nine numbers. 
The function returns a dictionary containing the mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and sum of the numbers. 
Each statistic is calculated across columns, rows, and the flattened matrix.

Requirements:
- Input list must contain exactly nine numbers; otherwise, a ValueError is raised.
- Uses NumPy for calculations.

Example Usage:
from mean_var_std import calculate

result = calculate([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])
print(result)

Expected Output:
{
  'mean': [[2.0, 5.0, 8.0], [1.0, 4.0, 7.0], 5.0],
  'variance': [[0.666..., 0.666..., 0.666...], [0.666..., 0.666..., 0.666...], 6.666...],
  'standard deviation': [[0.816..., 0.816..., 0.816...], [0.816..., 0.816..., 0.816...], 2.581...],
  'max': [[3, 6, 9], [7, 8, 9], 9],
  'min': [[1, 4, 7], [1, 2, 3], 1],
  'sum': [[6, 15, 24], [6, 15, 24], 45]
}

How to Run:
1. Ensure Python 3 and NumPy are installed.
2. Save `mean_var_std.py` in a folder.
3. Open a terminal in that folder.
4. Run the file or import the function in another script.

This project was completed as part of the freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python certification and demonstrates practical use of NumPy for numerical calculations and structuring results in a dictionary.
